# 🧰 Simple TypeScript Starter | 2020

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Scripts

#### `npm run api`

Lance le serveur et se mets en écoute

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

### Rimraf
npm install --save rimraf

### Cypress

npm install cypress --save-dev

> run : npx cypress open
> record tests e2e : npx cypress run --record --key 84330dcb-1088-4e89-bfc4-72d1c3f63c13
