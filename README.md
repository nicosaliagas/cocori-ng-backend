# ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2020

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Scripts

#### `npm run api`

Lance le serveur et se mets en Ã©coute

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.

### Rimraf
npm install --save rimraf

### API URL :
